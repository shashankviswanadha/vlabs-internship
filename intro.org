*Objective

The objective of this exercise is to build a full web application from scratch.

*Steps involved

**Understanding the requirements

The requirements of the application are to be clearly understood before we
actually begin the process of building the application.

**Building a model

After the requirements are understood we need to build a mathematical model of
the data that we are going to need for the application

**Code

Once the mathematical model is built, we convert this model into code using
object oriented programming.
